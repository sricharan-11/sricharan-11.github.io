## Long Introduction
My professional journey is defined by a relentless pursuit of architectural excellence and operational efficiency. I have spearheaded major cloud adoption strategies, designing modular and reusable blocks that perpetuate to the next stage of evolution. From architecting Landing Zones with high-availability NVAs to implementing cloud-native spokes with Kubernetes and ArgoCD, I ensure security and compliance are never afterthoughts.

I believe in the power of "Code as Gardening"—constant pruning and care. Whether it's revamping technical strategies for multi-cloud environments or leading engineering teams with personalized guidance, my goal is always to create captivating outcomes via predictive analysis and strategic advocations.

I am seeking an environment with openness for ideas, new perspectives, and room for cross-functional learning and ample growth.

# EA Corner

## DOs
- **Keep it Simple:** Great architecture is not the complex one, but a simple one that fits the scenario
- **Document Decisions:** ADRs are vital. Standardize delivery/changes procedures for audit compliance.
- **Define Priorities:** There's no ideal technology that would ever exist, choose the stack that caters to your priorities. 
- **Design for Failure:** Always assume components will fail and build resilience (BCDR Strategies).
- **Save Compute:** Save Environment.


## DON'Ts

- **Don't Design without Objectives:** There is no right or wrong way to design in this world, but there are right ways to design for achieving specific objectives.
- **Don't Over Engineer:** If your simple monolith has no tangible benefits from adopting microservices, forget it. Any fancy tech for peer pressure is a waste of time, when not associated with a tangible benefits.  
- **Don't Reinvent the Wheel:** until unless you are the wheel manufacturer.
- **Don't Automate Everything:** If it's not repeated manually more than 3 times, don't automate it.
- **Don't Optimize Prematurely:** Measure first, ensure you are optimizing the right bottlenecks.
- **Don't Couple Tightly:** Loose coupling allows independent evolution, like my microservices adoption.
- **Don't Start without a Don't List:** Scope sprawl, technology sprawl, budget sprawl are inevitable when the boundaries aren't set prior.

# Inferences & Analogies

### Code as Gardening
Software development is more like gardening than building. It requires constant pruning, watering, and care. You can't just build it and walk away; weeds (technical debt) will grow, and the environment (dependencies) will change.

### The Orchestra of Microservices
A monolith is a one-man band—easy to coordinate but limited in scale. Microservices are an orchestra. Each musician (service) must be excellent on their own, but the real magic happens with the conductor (orchestrator) and the sheet music (API contracts).
